## Technical Achievements

1. (5 points)
The following CSS rules were applied to enhance the webpage:
  1. **Body Styling**:
     - Font: The body uses the 'Roboto' font from Google Fonts, with Arial and sans-serif as fallbacks.
     - Background: A light beige color `#f7f5f2` is applied for a clean and modern look.
     - Margin and Padding: Both are set to `0` to remove default spacing.

  2. **Header**:
     - Background: A vibrant blue color `#2796E5` is used for the header.
     - Text Color: White text (`#fff`) ensures readability.
     - Padding: Adds vertical spacing for a balanced layout.
     - Box Shadow: A subtle shadow effect for depth.

  3. **Navigation Bar**:
     - Background: A soft green color `#92E5B3` is applied.
     - Links: Text is styled with a bold blue color `#2796E5`, and hover effects change the background to blue with white text.

  4. **Main Content**:
     - Background: White background for sections, with rounded corners and a shadow for a card-like appearance.
     - Padding: Adds spacing inside the content for readability.

  5. **Table**:
     - Borders: Light gray borders for cells.
     - Header Background: A bright yellow color `#E5E419` is used for table headers.
     - Alternating Rows: Even rows have a light greenish background for better readability.

  6. **Aside**:
     - Highlighted with a green background `#92E5B3` and rounded corners for emphasis.

Overall I found that breaking up the styling into these various components like body, header, and main content helped streamline the design easier. Also having this dedicated css document for the style helps make the code more organized, showing effectivness of encapsulation. Challenges I faced when making the css styles is forgetting the proper syntax, but a quick google search helped lots.

This animation is a simple fade into the main content of the webpage when loading at the first time. I did it inline in the HTML document. I have found the javascript has potential to liven up the website design, by having stuff like this animation.


3. (5 points) 

For semantic html tags I used: 
<img>: Used to add an image to the page. I added an image of WPI to spice up the page, make it more interesting than just a wall of text. 

<article>: Used to wrap the "About Me" content. This allows me to divide the big HTML document into sections, more specicially having "About Me" as its own seperate thing in a way, streamlines the code. 

<aside>: Added a fun fact about you. This is a little 'sidebar' if you will, to add something more interesting than academics, by saying stuff like sports. Adding this tag allows me to differentiate between the core knowledge I want the reader to see, the more important stuff, from the less important stuff, like me training for a 1/2 marathon. 

<details>: Again, helps differeniate between different knowledge, so thats nice. 

<summary>: Acts as a clickable summary for the <details> section.  Used to provide additional information about your courses. Adding this details tag allows for a built-in dropdown, to show more hidden detail. Useful for if you have lots of information, and don't want to overwelm the user, so having the option of hiding some stuff is useful.

## Design Achievements
1. (10 points) 
The color palate I chose is 3 colors. Green, Blue, and Yellow. The hardest part of making this color palate is figuring out how to use the software of adobe. I found myself fiddling with it for a good 10 minutes before figuring how to remove colors from the palate, and how to select colors. Integrating into the website, however, was not much of a challenge since I was simply able to assign a color to a a component, and as such it worked out fine. 

2. (5 points) 
The font I chose from google fonts is Roboto. I just simply referenced the embed code in the head of my html document.
